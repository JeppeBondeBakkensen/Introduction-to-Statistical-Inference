In this section we will formalize the concept of data connected to scientific study. Broadly speaking, data is anything we observe that is relevant to answering a question of interest, i.e., data is tacitly assumed to be informative about the question. Three types of studies in which data are collected and analyzed are in designed, interventional experiments, observational studies, and exploratory studies. The following illustrations help to differentiate these two types of studies. One difference we will see is all about timingexperiments start with a question of interest and then are designed to answer the question. Exploratory data analysis is often done using data collected with no particular question in mind, or some other question besides the current one. Another difference is that experiments require interventionsimposed changes of behavior or conditions on the individuals in the experimentwhile observational studies do not include such interventions. 2.1.1 James Linds Scurvy Trial Clinical trials are familiar designed, interventional experiments. A famous, early example is James Linds Scurvy trial. Lind was a doctor aboard a British ship. Several sailors with him were suffering from scurvy. He selected 12 sailors in similar, poor condition, and assigned to pairs of them 6 different treatments (the intervention). The two who received oranges and lemons to eat recovered fully; those who received apple cider fared next best. Lind specifically wanted to understand which treatments would be most effective at curing scurvy and planned an experiment to answer his question. His selection of like sailors and random, paired treatment assignment constitute early examples of randomization and control in experimental design. 2.1.2 Framingham Heart Study Named for Framingham, Massachusetts, where the participants were first recruited, this was a long-running observational study of Americans aimed at understanding risks associated with heart disease. Participants agreed to medical testing every 3-5 years, from which the study researchers concluded a number of important findings, such as cigarette smoking substantially increases the risk of heart disease. There are no interventions; the researchers simply observe the patients and make conclusions based on how the patients choose to live, e.g., tobacco use. 2.1.3 Harris Bank Sex Pay Study 93 salaries of entry-level clerical workers who started working at Harris Bank between 1969 and 1971 show men were paid more than women. (From The Statistical Sleuth, reproduced from Harris Trust and Savings Bank: An Analysis of Employee Compensation (1979), Report 7946,Center for Mathematical Studies in Business and Economics, University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.) 2.1.4 Large, Aggregated Data Sets There are now many large data sets recording all sorts of information about consumers, e.g., data obtained by Google and other technology companies whenever consumers use their sites, apps, or devices. There are many potential use cases for such information; for instance, such data has proven helpful for targeted marketing of specific products. Such applications may be termed exploratory researchthese are characterized, in part, by exploration/examination of data that was originally collected for some other purpose. In other words, the data was collected with either no question or some other question in mind. 2.1.5 Study Concepts The above examples illustrate several key concepts related to scientific studies. Research question - There is always a reason researchers go to the trouble of collecting and analysing data; they have an important question they want to answer. For example, what can sailors do to prevent scurvy? Experimental units/Subjects - the research question usually references people, things, animals, or some other entity that can be studied in order to answer the question. When these are observed and measured then they are called experimental units or subjects. In the context of interventional experiments these usually refer to the units of randomization; see below. Data - we are inundated with information, numbers, figures, and graphs in our everyday lives. Is this data? Anything information gathered to answer a particular research question can be considered data. Relevancy to a research question is key. Intervention - When James Lind gave different foods to sick sailors he was making an intervention, and his goal was to study the effect of his interventions on the sailors well-being. Experiments include one or more interventions, whereas observational studies do not feature any interventions on the part of the researcher. Randomization - When researchers intervene, they should apply their interventions randomly with respect to subjects. In experiments the experimental units are the entities that are randomized and given interventions. Response/outcome variables - studies often measure multiple variables and study relationships between them. Typically the researchers expect one variable is affected by another. The response, or outcomelike the health of sailors, or pay of workersis the variable being affected by the intervention in an experiment or by another, independent variable in an observational study. Control - Researchers should try to limit the effects of variables on the response that are not of interest to the study. For example, in the gender pay study, the researchers studied only entry-level workers. They controlled for prior experience to better isolate potential sex effects on pay. 2.1.6 Randomization, control, and causation In experiments the researcher performs one or more interventionssuch as giving patients cider versus citrus fruits in Linds scurvy trial. The principle of randomization asserts that interventions in experiments should be assigned to experimental units randomly. When experimental units are heterogeneousnot all the sameit stands to reason that some of their differences apart from the intervention may impact the response to the experiment recorded by the researcher. Randomization is a way to even out these heterogeneities between groups receiving different interventions. That way, it is the intervention, rather than some other difference, which is responsible for substantially different outcomes. Randomization systematically accounts for heterogeneities, but the extent to which it works depends on the number of experimental units, the number of groups being randomized, and the presence of one or more important heterogeneities. For examples, consider the following: 1. Suppose in ten experimental units there is one unobserved, dichotomous trait that affects the experimental response. Three of the ten have version 0 of the trait and 7 have version 1. Randomly split the ten into two groups of five, each group to receive a different intervention. The chance all three end up in the same group is 1/6, not ignorably small 2. On the other hand, suppose there are 100 experimental units, half have trait 0 and half trait 1. The chance at least 35 of either trait type end up in the same one half random split is \\(\\approx 0\\). Generally when an intervention is randomized over experimental units we interpret any significant difference in outcome/response between intervenion groups as having been caused by the intervention itself, as opposed to some other unobserved characteristicthese are sometimes called lurking variables or confounding variables. But, randomization is not foolproof; small sample sizes (few experimental units) and/or the presence of many confounding variables can reduce the effectiveness of randomization. When the researcher knows about potential confounders ahead of time, the principle of blocking says experimental units should be representatively divided with respect to intervention across values of this variable. For example, if experimental units are humans both young and old, then the different interventions should be applied to equal numbers of young and old people. One way to accomplish this is to let age group be a blocking factor. In the case of a dichotomous intervention this means half of the old people will be randomly assigned to one intervention and half of the young people will be randomly assigned to one interventionas opposed to randomly assigning half of all the experimental units to one intervention. The principle of control states that intervention groups should be made as homogeneous as possible. When experiments are well-controlled researchers often assume that they can determine causation, and any observed differences in experimental outcome between intervention groups can be attributed to the intervention. Of course, as mentioned above, the ability of an experiment to determine causation is not all or nothing; rather, it depends on unknowns. Nevertheless, stronger controls make the results of experiments more trustworthy, and less likely to be caused by confounding variables. Non-interventional, observational studies are not used to establish causative relationships. Rather, we say such studies establish associations between variables. For example, in the Framingham study, the researchers did not randomly assign individuals to groups of tobacco-users and non-users. Even though these days the evidence is quite strong that tobacco use causes heart disease, the bar for such a claim is much higher when the variable of interesttobacco usecannot be randomly assigned to experimental units. Thats not to say elements of control cannot be used. For instance, if enough data is collected, it is possible to compare tobacco-users and non-users with nearly the same ages, sexes, incomes, education, living in the same zip codes, etc. The more potential confounders are explicitly controlled, the closer such an observational study comes to a randomized experiment. 2.1.7 Populations and scope of inference Whether conducting an experiment or collecting observational data, the units/subjects have to come from somewhere. The population refers to the set of all possible subjectsit may be finite or infinite, and it may be concrete or hypothetical. For examples, the population of current Iowa State undergraduates is well-defined, whereas the population of mouse kidney cells exists in a hypothetical sense. Sampling describes how subjects are obtained from the population for observation. Random sampling is any scheme involving selecting a subset of subjects from a larger group in some random fashion. A simple random sample of size \\(n\\) is obtained when every subset of \\(n\\) subjects from a total group is equally likely to be selected. Other types of random selection are possible, but we wont often consider these: - stratified random sampling obtains when simple random samples from separate groups/strata are combined, e.g., a 50/50 random sample stratified by male/female can be formed by taking a simple random sample of ten males and a simple random sample of 10 females from a group of 50 males and 50 females - cluster random sampling obtains when a larger group is subdivided into smaller groups and subgroups are selected at random, e.g., a cluster random sample of Iowa high schoolers can be obtained by choosing all high schoolers who attend one of a simple random sample of Iowa high schools. Generally, conclusions about subjects in the studywhether it is an experiment or an observational studymay be assumed to hold for the wider population as a whole when the subjects are chosen randomly. The details of this generalizability of results depend on the type of random sampling conducted; well focus on the case of simple random sampling specifically. On the other hand, when subjects are not randomly sampled from the population, study results cannot be generalized back to the population. The reason is that the lack of randomness in selection implies some subsets of the population are more or less likely to be present in the sample of subjects observed, hence, that sample is not necessarily representative of the population. For an extreme example, consider a population of both young and old people and an experiment studying the effects of Covid-19. Its well-known Covid-19 is much more harmful to old people compared to young people. So this is a potential confounder. If we select only young people to study, then we certainly cannot claim the results would be similar had we studied both young and old people. Non-random sampling schemes are quite common because they are usually easier and cheaper to implement than random sampling schemes. A convenience sample is just what it sounds likea rule that selects subjects that are easy to selectsuch as conducting a poll of your closest friends. When a non-random sample is used, remember that the results cannot be interpreted beyond the group subjects that were observed. Sometimes a researcher intends to study one population, but obtains data from another population. This mismatch is important to identify as it can cause biaswhich simply means the answer to the researchers question is different for the population for which data is observed compared to the intended population. As in the extreme example above, effects of Covid-19 are different in old and young populations, so the results from an experiment studying only the young are biased when viewed from the perspective of the population of old and young combined. 2.2 Data Summaries Data may take on many forms including sound waves, images comprised of pixels/voxels, and graphs of functions/surfaces. We will almost exclusively consider data that may be represented in a tabulated format, like the following data on weights of chickens. ## weight Time Chick Diet ## 1 42 0 1 1 ## 2 51 2 1 1 ## 3 59 4 1 1 ## 4 64 6 1 1 ## 5 76 8 1 1 ## 6 93 10 1 1 Regardless of the type of data, few users can make sense of all the data at once; rather, we need data summariesnumbers or plots that point out important features of the whole data set. 2.2.1 Numerical Summaries We briefly describe summaries for categorical and numerical, continuous data. Suppose a variable \\(X\\) takes categorical values, e.g., \\(X\\in\\{0,1,2,3\\}\\). A data set consisting of observed \\(x\\) values, may be summarized by tabulating proportions, i.e., of 100 observations, 0.41 were \\(x=0\\), 0.29 were \\(x = 1\\), 0.17 were \\(x = 2\\) and 0.13 were \\(x=3\\). Binary or dichotomous variables may be also be summarized by odds and odds ratios. Suppose \\(Y\\in\\{0,1\\}\\). The observations \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_n\\) may be summarized by saying \\(60\\%\\) were \\(y=1\\) versus \\(40\\%\\) \\(y=0\\) or, equivalently, the observed odds of \\(y=1\\) was \\(0.6/0.4 = 1.5\\). Suppose response \\(Y\\) is blocked by another dichotomous variable, say, undergraduate versus graduate status, and suppose the observed odds for undergraduates is 1.5 while the observed odds for graduates is 0.8. Then, the observed odds ratio for undergraduates versus graduates is 1.5/0.8 = 1.875. In contrast to categorical data, continuous data takes values in the real numbers \\(\\mathbb{R}\\) or some interval of real numbers. Most numerical summaries of continuous variables either measure location or dispersion. Location refers, in one way or another, to a typical or average value while dispersion refers to the spread of the values. Common measures of location are the mean, median, and trimmed mean: The mean of \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\) is \\(\\overline x = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\). The median is denoted \\(\\tilde x\\). Sort the \\(x\\)s from least to greatest labeling them as \\(x_{(1)}, \\ldots, x_{(n)}\\). Then, \\(\\tilde x = x_{(\\frac{n+1}{2})}\\) if \\(n\\) is odd and \\(\\tilde x = \\tfrac12\\left(x_{(\\frac{n}{2})} + x_{(\\frac{n}{2}+1)}\\right)\\) if \\(n\\) is even. The \\(\\alpha\\%\\) trimmed mean is the mean of the remaining \\(x\\) values after ignoring the smallest and largest \\(\\alpha\\%\\) of values. Roughly, the \\(\\alpha\\%\\) trimmed mean averages \\(x_{(1+\\alpha n)},\\ldots, x_{n - \\alpha n - 1}\\). Besides the median, we may be interested in locations besides the center, and these could be summarized using quantiles. Observed quantiles may be defined in a number of ways. One definition says the \\(\\alpha\\in(0,1)\\) quantile is the smallest observed \\(x\\) value such that at least \\(\\alpha\\%\\) of observed \\(x\\) values are no more than \\(x\\). Common measures of dispersion include the variance and standard deviation, the range, and the interquartile range: The observed variance of \\(x_1, \\ldots, x_n\\) is given by \\(\\tfrac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\overline x)^2\\) and may be equivalently computed as \\(\\tfrac{1}{n-1}\\left\\{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i^2) - n\\overline x^2\\right\\}\\). In the calculation of variance the \\(x\\) values are squared, which means the variance has units equal to the squared units of \\(x\\); that is, if \\(x\\) is measured in millimeters then its variance is measured in millimeters squared, or, e.g., dollars then dollars squared. Often the squared units are difficult to interpret. Instead, we define the standard deviation as the square root of the variance, which shares the units of the observed \\(x\\) variable. The range is the difference between maximum and minimum values, i.e., \\(x_{(n)} - x_{(1)}\\). The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the \\(0.75\\) and \\(0.25\\) quantiles. 2.2.2 Visual Summaries Plots and graphs can also be used to summarize a data set or particular observed variable. Three plots we will use extensively in the course are the scatterplot, histogram, and quantile-quantile (qq) plot. For paired observations of two variables \\((x_i, y_i), \\,\\,i = 1, \\ldots, n\\) a scatterplot displays \\((x_i, y_i)\\) in the xy-plane. For example, see the plot of a chickens weight versus time from the tabulated data set above. Scatterplots are useful for assessing relationships between variables. For example, the chicks weight increases with time, maybe in a linear or slightly quadratic fashion. For a single variable a histogram summarizes the distribution of its observed values by counting the numer of observations in different intervals (buckets) of values. Keep in mind that histograms with different choices of buckets may look very different. Check out this histogram of Time 0 weights of all 23 chicks. A qq-plot compares the shape of a distribution of observed values to another known distribution, often the standard normal distribution. For example, make the standardizing transformation \\((x_i - \\overline x) / \\hat\\sigma_x\\) where \\(x_i\\) is the Time 0 weight of chick \\(i\\), \\(\\overline x\\) is the observed mean and \\(\\hat\\sigma_x\\) is the observed standard deviation of those values. Compute the \\(\\alpha\\) quantile of these values or several \\(\\alpha\\) values in \\((0,1)\\) along with the corresponding standard normal quantiles (z-scores). Plot the pairs of \\(\\alpha\\) quantiles in the xy-plane. If the standardized weights are approximately normal, then the points should lie approximately on the line \\(y=x\\). Note that extreme quantiles are always less reliably estimated, so it is typical for the ends of the line to fray up or down from the diagonal. 2.3 Statistical Inference Summarizing data sets is important because no one can make sense of more than a few numbers at a time. But, data summaries cannot by themselves answer our research questions. That is because data summaries only say something about the particular data set we observe, while our research questions concern the whole population. Recall, a major aim of experimentation is generalizing from observations to population. When we make such generalizations we often refer to them as inferences; and, statistical inferences are characterized by their careful treatment of statistical concepts, such as hypotheses, and Type 1 and 2 errors, which we discuss below. A hypothesis is a claim or assertion about a population. These may be simple, i.e., the population mean is 5, or more complex, like the population distribution of values is equivalent to a Normal probability distribution. Notice that both of these statements are either true or false, yes or no. A hypothesis then may be called the null hypothesis, and its complement (opposite) the alternative hypothesis. Which is which depends on the context. We make educated guesses about the truthfulness of a null hypothesis based on observations/data. Our educated guesses may be right or wrong, but we will never know because we will never see the whole population. If we reject the null hypothesis as false when it really is true, then we make a Type 1 error. The opposite, keeping the null hypothesis in favor over its alternative, when it is actually false, is a Type 2 error. Ideally, we would make no errors, but thats not possible. In fact, the two errors have an inverse relation. For example, if we adopt the rule that we always reject the null hypothesis, then we will necessarily maximize Type 1 errors but have no Type 2 errors. And, if we take the opposite approach, then we maximize Type 2 errors while making no Type 1 errors. Much of this course will focus on constructing tests of relevant hypotheses with the property that we limit the chance of making a Type 1 error. By chance we refer to the probability distribution of the test outcome induced by random sampling of data from the population. A test that has chance no more than \\(\\alpha\\) of making a Type 1 error is called a level \\(\\alpha\\) test of \\(H_0\\), the null hypothesis.

The sampling distribution of observations is known up to the value(s) of some population parameter(s). The goal of this chapter is to study estimationapproximation of these unknown parameters by statistics, functions of the sample data. An estimator is the random variable version of a statistic and has a corresponding sampling distribution. By virtue of being called an estimator we assume this statistic is close to the true parameter value in some sense. An estimate is a value of an estimator after the data is collected and the estimator computed; it is a fixed, non-random value. For example, consider an experiment sampling \\(n\\) iid random samples from a Normal population with unknown mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(1\\). Here \\(\\mu\\) is the parameter we wish to estimate. An intuitive estimator is the sample mean statistic \\(\\overline X_n = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\). When the data is collected we refer to the calculated sample meanthe estimate of \\(\\mu\\)as lowercase \\(\\overline x_n\\). 3.2 Properties of Estimators It will become apparent that estimators are not uniquethere are very often several seemingly reasonable estimators for a single parameter. Therefore we ought to be concerned with choosing the best estimator according to some criteria. Different criteria will lead to different best estimators. 3.2.1 Bias and Unbiasedness Consider a generic parameter denoted \\(\\theta\\) and imagine an estimator for \\(\\theta\\) called \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\), which is a statistic and, hence, a random variable. We say \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is unbiased if \\(E(\\hat\\theta_n)=\\theta\\) where the expectation is taken with respect to the sampling distribution of \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\). For example, the sample mean \\(\\overline X_n\\) is unbiased for the population mean \\(\\mu\\) (so long as the population mean exists): \\[\\begin{align*} E(\\overline X_n) &amp;= E\\left(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\right)\\\\ &amp; = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n E(X_i)\\\\ &amp; = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\mu\\\\ &amp; = \\mu. \\end{align*}\\] An unbiased estimator commits no systematic errors in estimating the parameter. In contrast, a biased estimator of a univariate real-valued parameter systematically underestimates or overestimates the parameter. Consider biased \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) such that \\(E(\\hat\\theta_n) = \\theta + 1\\). We expect \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) to be 1 more than \\(\\theta\\)hence we expect it to overestimate. 3.2.2 Minimum Variance Unbiased Estimators Besides a finite mean, estimators often have a finite variance. And, intuitively, we would tend to prefer an estimator with low variance to one with high variance, particularly if both are unbiased. If we insist on an unbiased estimator, then the best unbiased estimator is the unbiased estimator with smallest variance among all unbiased estimators. It is not obvious how one would find the lowest variance estimator among all unbiased estimators. One result, due to CR Rao and Harald Cramer, provides a lower bound on the variance of an unbiased estimator. This lower bound can be checked by computing the variance of a given unbiased estimator, and, if they match, this implies the given estimator is the MVUE. We describe this procedure below. Let \\(f(x;\\theta)\\) denote the density of the data and let \\(\\theta\\) denote a univariate parameter. Let \\(\\ell(x;\\theta) := \\log(f(x;\\theta))\\), the natural logarithm of the density. Define the Fisher Information for one data point by \\[I(\\theta) = E\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ell(x;\\theta)}{\\partial\\theta}\\right)^2\\right].\\] The Fisher information for a random sample of size \\(n\\) is \\(n\\) times \\(I(\\theta)\\). Then, Cramer and Rao showed that if \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is unbiased, its variance cannot be smaller than \\[V(\\hat\\theta_n)\\geq \\left[nI(\\theta)\\right]^{-1}\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the true parameter value. Example: Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample from a normal population with variance 1 and mean \\(\\mu\\) and consider the estimator \\(\\overline X_n\\). The logarithm of the density function is \\[\\ell(f(x;\\mu)) = -\\log(\\sqrt{2\\pi}) - \\tfrac12(x - \\mu)^2\\] with \\(\\mu-\\)derivative \\(x - \\mu\\). Therefore, the Fisher Information is \\[I(\\mu) = E[(X - \\mu)^2] = 1\\] since it is, by definition, equal to the variance. The Cramer-Rao lower bound is \\[V(\\hat\\theta_n)\\geq \\frac{1}{n},\\] and we know \\(V(\\overline X_n) = 1/n\\) so the sample mean \\(\\overline X_n\\) is, indeed, the MVUE for this experiment. 3.2.3 Mean Squared Error and Bias-Variance tradeoff As described above a common strategy is to select an unbiased estimator, preferably one with low (or the lowest) variance. On the other hand, one may prefer a biased estimator over an unbiased one if the bias is low and there is substantial reduction in variance. One way to choose estimators that balance bias and variance is to consider their mean squared error (MSE), defined by \\[MSE(\\hat\\theta_n) = E[(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta)^2] = Bias(\\theta_n)^2 + V(\\hat\\theta_n).\\] It is left as an exercise to the reader to show the MSE equals the sum of estimator variance and squared bias. For the above reasons the estimator minimizing the MSE may be preferable even to the MVUE. Example: Estimation of a normal population variance The usual variance estimator is the sample variance \\(S^2_n = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline X_n)^2\\). It can be checked this estimator is unbiased. And, it is a bit of a pain, but it can be shown that \\(V(S_n^2) = \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1}\\). Now, consider an alternative estimator that is a constant multiple of \\(S^2_n\\), say \\(c S_n^2\\) for some \\(c&gt;0\\). The MSE of this estimator is \\[\\begin{align*} MSE(cS_n^2) &amp;= V(cS_n^2) + Bias(cS_n^2)^2\\\\ &amp; = c^2\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1} + [E(cS_n^2) - \\sigma^2]^2\\\\ &amp; = c^2\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1} + (c\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2)^2\\\\ &amp; = c^2\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1} + \\sigma^4(c-1)^2. \\end{align*}\\] Differentiate w.r.t. \\(c\\) to find \\[\\frac{\\partial MSE}{\\partial c} = 2c \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n-1} + 2(c-1)\\sigma^4.\\] Set this equal to zero and solve for \\(c\\). We get \\[c = \\frac{2\\sigma^4}{\\frac{4\\sigma^4}{n-1} + 2\\sigma^4} = \\frac{n-1}{2+n-1} = \\frac{n-1}{n+1}.\\] This means the minimim MSE estimator (at least among those that are multiples of \\(S_n^2\\)) is actually \\(\\frac{1}{n+1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline X_n)^2\\). 3.2.4 Consistency Besides avoiding systematic estimation errors and having low variance, we would expect that as more and more data is collected an estimator should get better and betterand get closer to the true parameter, in some sense. This intuition is captured mathematically by consistency. An estimator is consistent if for any \\(c&gt;0\\), however small, \\[\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} P(|\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta|&gt;c) = 0.\\] Dissecting this definition from the inside out we first note \\(|\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta|\\) is the random estimation error. Then, \\(|\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta|&gt;c\\) says the error is at least \\(c\\). Since the error is a random variable we attach a probability to the chance the error is at least \\(c\\), which is \\(P(|\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta|&gt;c)\\). And, consistency says this probability must vanish as we accumulate data. So, the chance of an error of any size \\(c\\) or bigger vanishes. Taking complements, this is equivalent to saying \\[\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} P(|\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta|&lt;c) = 1,\\] which means \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is within \\(c\\) of \\(\\theta\\) with probability going to 1. One way to show an estimator is consistent is to show it is unbiased and has variance that vanishes as \\(n\\rightarrow 0\\). One example is the sample mean, which is unbiased and has variance \\(\\sigma^2/n\\). Then, consistency follows by Chebyshevs inequality, which says: for any r.v. \\(X\\) with finite mean and variance \\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\), \\[P(|X - \\mu|&gt;c)\\leq \\frac{\\sigma^2}{c^2}\\] for any \\(c&gt;0\\). In the context of estimation, we have \\[P(|\\hat\\theta_n - E(\\hat\\theta_n)|&gt;c) \\leq \\frac{Var(\\hat\\theta_n)}{c^2}.\\] Now, suppose \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is unbiased and its variance vanishes in \\(n\\). Then, the above statement says \\[P(|\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta|&gt;c) \\leq s_n.\\] for a sequence \\(s_n\\) satisfying \\(\\lim_{n\\rightarrow \\infty} s_n = 0\\). Checking the definition we see this means \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) is consistent. A similar argument can work for biased estimators as well, provided the bias also vanishes as \\(n\\rightarrow\\infty\\). Such estimators are called asymptotically unbiased. One such example is the minimum MSE estimator of \\(\\sigma^2\\) from the previous section. It has bias \\(\\sigma^2(\\frac{n-1}{n+1}-1)\\) which has limit zero. 3.3 Finding estimators - Method of Moments So far weve discussed desirable properties of estimators but not where these estimators come from. How do we find estimators in the first place? One strategy is based on the fact population parameters often are related to population moments. Then, we can find estimators by replacing population moments by sample moments and referring back to the relationship between the moments and parameters. The simplest example of the method of moments is estimation of the population mean by the sample mean. Example: Suppose a population is modeled as a Gamma distribution with shape and rate parameters \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\). The population mean is \\(\\alpha / \\beta\\) and the population variance is \\(\\alpha / \\beta^2\\). This means the population second raw moment is \\(\\alpha / \\beta^2 + (\\alpha / \\beta)^2\\). We can estimate \\((\\alpha, \\beta)\\) by matching the sample and population raw moments as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i &amp;= \\alpha/\\beta^2\\\\ n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 &amp;= \\alpha/\\beta^2 + (\\alpha / \\beta)^2. \\end{align*}\\] Solving the system by substitution we have \\[\\begin{align*} \\hat\\alpha = \\frac{\\hat\\mu_2&#39; - \\hat\\mu_1&#39;}{\\hat\\mu_1&#39;}\\\\ \\hat \\beta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat\\mu_2&#39; - \\hat\\mu_1&#39;}{(\\hat\\mu_1&#39;)^2}}, \\end{align*}\\] where \\(\\hat\\mu_1&#39;\\) and \\(\\hat\\mu_2&#39;\\) indicate the 1st and second raw sample moments \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\) and \\(n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2\\). Example: Suppose we will take a random sample of size \\(n\\) from a continuous uniform distribution supported on the interval \\((a,b)\\) where the endpoints are unknown. We know that \\(E(X) = \\frac{a+b}{2}\\) and \\(V(X) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12}\\) so that \\(E(X^2) = \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12} + \\frac{(a+b)^2}{4}\\). Then, we find estimators for \\((a,b)\\) by solving \\[\\begin{align*} n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i &amp;= \\frac{a+b}{2}\\\\ n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^2 &amp;= \\frac{(b-a)^2}{12} + \\frac{(a+b)^2}{4}. \\end{align*}\\] With some work, you should find \\((\\hat a, \\hat b) = (\\hat\\mu_1&#39; - \\sqrt{3\\hat\\mu_2&#39;}, \\, \\hat\\mu_1&#39;+\\sqrt{3\\hat\\mu_2&#39;})\\). Thats not so intuitive What about using the sample minimum and maximum 3.4 Method of Maximum Likelihood Again consider a random sample \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) from a population synonymous with a density function \\(f(x;\\theta)\\) for an unknown parameter \\(\\theta\\). For the time being consider only scalar \\(\\theta\\). The likelihood function is the joint PDF of the data viewed as a function of the parameter, and may be treated either as a random function or as a deterministic function depending on whether the data are treates as random variables or as observed values, so pay close attention to the context. For iid data the likelihood can be written \\[L(\\theta;X_1, \\ldots, X_n) = \\prod_{i=1}^n f(X_i;\\theta).\\] For the purpose of estimating \\(\\theta\\) we view the likelihood as a deterministic function given observations. Then, it acts as a sort of ranking function that provides a quantitative comparison of how well different parameter values agree with the observed data. The idea is to select as an estimate the parameter value that maximizes the likelihood/agreement with the data. To explain this concept of agreement with the data a bit more suppose the data come from a discrete population so that \\(f(x;\\theta)\\) is a PMF rather than a densitythis makes the interpretation easier. Then \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n f(X_i;\\theta)\\) is a the probability of observing the data for a given parameter value \\(\\theta\\). Choosing \\(\\theta\\) to maximize this probability means selecting the distribution that gives the highest probability assignment to the data that was actually observed. Example: Suppose our random sample comes from an Exponential distribution with rate \\(\\lambda\\). The likelihood function equals \\[\\begin{align*} L(\\lambda, x_1, \\ldots, x_n) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\lambda^{-1}e^{-x_i/\\lambda}\\\\ &amp; = \\lambda ^{-n}e^{-\\tfrac1\\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}. \\end{align*}\\] Take the first derivative of the likleihood with respect to \\(\\lambda\\): \\[\\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = -n\\lambda^{-(n+1)}e^{-\\tfrac1\\lambda \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i} + \\lambda^{-n}e^{-\\tfrac1\\lambda\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}\\left(\\lambda^{-2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\right)\\] Set \\(\\tfrac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda}\\) equal to zero and solve for \\(\\lambda\\) to obtain the MLE: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial \\lambda} = 0 &amp; \\Rightarrow -n\\lambda^{-1} + \\tfrac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i = 0\\\\ &amp; \\Rightarrow n\\lambda = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i\\\\ &amp; \\Rightarrow \\hat{\\theta}_{MLE} = \\overline x_n. \\end{align*}\\] Example: Suppose our random sample comes from a Uniform distribution on the interval \\((0,\\theta)\\). The likelihood function equals \\[\\begin{align*} L(\\lambda, x_1, \\ldots, x_n) &amp;= \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{\\theta}1(0\\leq x_i\\leq \\theta) \\\\ &amp; = \\theta^{-n}\\prod_{i=1}^n 1(0\\leq x_i\\leq \\theta). \\end{align*}\\] We cannot simply maximize this likelihood function by taking the first derivative because the indicator functions are not everywhere differentiable w.r.t. \\(\\theta\\). Instead, note that the function \\(\\theta^{-n}\\) is monotonically decreasing in \\(\\theta\\); so, this function prefers small \\(\\theta\\). On the other hand, the function \\(\\prod_{i=1}^n 1(0\\leq x_i\\leq \\theta)\\) is constant and equal to 1 so long as \\(\\theta \\geq \\max_{i=1, \\ldots, n} x_i\\); otherwise, this function is zero and so is the likelihood (and the likelihood cannot be less than zero!). This means we should choose \\(\\theta = \\max_{i=1, \\ldots, n} x_i\\) to maximize the likelihood. Therefore, the MLE of \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\hat\\theta_{MLE} = max_{i=1, \\ldots, n} x_i\\). Multivariate Example: Consider estimation of both the mean and variance parameters of a normal population based on a random sample of size \\(n\\) denoted \\(X^n = (X_1, \\ldots, X_n)^\\top\\). The likelihood is a function of two parameters \\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\): \\[L(\\mu, \\sigma^2;X^n) = (2\\pi\\sigma^2)^{-n/2}\\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)^2\\right).\\] The loglikelihood is easier to maximize so take the log and find \\[\\ell(\\mu, \\sigma^2;X^n) = -\\frac{n}{2}\\log (2\\pi\\sigma^2) -\\frac{1}{2\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)^2. \\] To find the MLEs we need to compute the gradient vector: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial \\mu} &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\sigma^2}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial \\sigma^2} &amp;= -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^2} + \\frac{1}{2\\sigma^4}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)^2. \\end{align*}\\] Setting \\(\\frac{\\partial\\ell}{\\partial \\mu}=0\\) we immediately find \\(\\hat\\mu_{MLE} = \\overline X_n\\). Substituting this estimate for \\(\\mu\\) in the second equation we find \\(\\hat\\sigma^2_{MLE} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\overline X_n)^2\\), the version of the sample variance with denominator \\(n\\) instead of \\(n-1\\). The following result says the MLE has variance approximately equal to the reciprocal of the Fisher information when the parameter is a scalar. In the multivariate setting the analogous quantity is the inverse Fisher information matrix, which is the inverse of the expectation of \\(-1\\) times the matrix of second partial derivatives of the loglikelihood. Lets calculate this variance-covariance matrix next. First, we need to compute the matrix of second partial derivatives of the loglikelihood: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial \\mu^2} &amp;= -\\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial \\mu\\partial\\sigma^2} &amp;= -\\frac{1}{\\sigma^4}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)\\\\ \\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial (\\sigma^2)^2} &amp;= \\frac{n}{2\\sigma^4} - \\frac{1}{\\sigma^6}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i-\\mu)^2 \\end{align*}\\] Next, take the expectation of these partial derivatives and multiply by \\(-1\\): \\[\\begin{align*} -E(\\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial \\mu^2}) &amp;= \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2}\\\\ -E(\\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial \\mu\\partial\\sigma^2}) &amp;= 0\\\\ -E(\\frac{\\partial^2\\ell}{\\partial (\\sigma^2)^2}) &amp;= -\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^4} + \\frac{n}{\\sigma^4} = \\frac{n}{2\\sigma^4}. \\end{align*}\\] Finally, find the inverse of the matrix: \\[\\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{n}{\\sigma^2} &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp;\\frac{n}{2\\sigma^4}. \\end{bmatrix}\\] Since this is a diagonal matrix, the inverse is simply the matrix of reciprocal values on the diagonal: \\[Cov(\\hat\\mu_{MLE}, \\hat\\sigma^2_{MLE}) \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{n} &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp;\\frac{2\\sigma^4}{n}. \\end{bmatrix}\\] according to the asymptotic results on MLEs given below. Since the unknown parameter \\(\\sigma^2\\) shows up in this covariance matrix, in practice we replace it with its estimate, yielding the estimated covariance matrix \\[\\widehat {Cov}(\\hat\\mu_{MLE}, \\hat\\sigma^2_{MLE}) \\approx \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{\\hat\\sigma_{MLE}^2}{n} &amp;0 \\\\ 0 &amp;\\frac{2\\hat\\sigma_{MLE}^4}{n}. \\end{bmatrix}\\] 3.5 Properties of MLEs Maximum likelihood estimation is a powerful technique because it produces estimators with good properties in a wide range of settings. These properties include consistency, asymptotic unbiasedness, asymptotic efficiency (attainment of the Cramer-Rao lower variance bound), and asymptotic normality; subject to the fulfilment of regularity conditions. These conditions include 1. Indentifiability - the CDF \\(F(x; \\theta)\\) satisfies \\(\\theta\\ne\\theta\\Rightarrow F(x;\\theta)\\ne F(x;\\theta&#39;)\\) for all \\(x\\) 2. The sample sapce of the PDF does not depend on \\(\\theta\\). 3. The true \\(\\theta^\\star\\) is not on the boundary of the domain of \\(\\theta\\). 4. The PDF \\(f(x;\\theta)\\) is three-times differentiable in \\(\\theta\\), and for all \\(\\theta\\) in a neighborhood of \\(\\theta^\\star\\) the function \\(|\\frac{\\partial^3}{\\partial\\theta^3}\\log f(X;\\theta)|\\) is bounded by a function \\(M(X)\\) with finite mean. 5. We can differentiate \\(\\int f(x;\\theta)dx\\) twice wr.t. \\(\\theta\\) by exchanging the order of integration and differentiation (limits). Some of these conditions can be weakened, depending on the property one is trying to prove, and in some cases by making more advanced arguments, but these are the conditions we will use to establish asymptotic normality below. Proof sketch of asymptotic normality: Define the loglikelihood function \\(\\ell(\\theta):=\\log L(\\theta;X_1, \\ldots, X_n)\\) and expand its first derivative in Taylor series about the MLE \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) as follows: \\[\\ell&#39;(\\hat\\theta_n) = \\ell&#39;(\\theta^\\star) + (\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta^\\star)\\ell&#39;&#39;(\\theta^\\star) + \\tfrac12(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta^\\star)^2\\ell&#39;&#39;&#39;(\\tilde\\theta),\\] where \\(\\tilde\\theta\\) is some value between \\(\\hat\\theta_n\\) and \\(\\theta^\\star\\) by Taylors theorem. Rearranging terms we have \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta^\\star) = \\frac{n^{-1/2}\\ell&#39;(\\theta^\\star)}{-n^{-1}\\ell&#39;&#39;(\\theta^\\star) - (2n)^{-1}(\\hat\\theta_n-\\theta^\\star)\\ell&#39;&#39;&#39;(\\tilde\\theta)}.\\] The CLT implies the numerator on the RHS above converges in distribution to \\(N(0, I(\\theta^\\star))\\). The weak LLN implies the first term in the denominator converges to \\(I(\\theta^\\star)\\) in probability. By the fourth regularity condition and the weak LLN the term \\(\\tfrac1n \\ell&#39;&#39;&#39;(\\tilde\\theta)\\) in the denominator converges to \\(E(M(X))\\) and hence, is bounded in probability. This term is multiplied by \\((\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta^\\star)\\) which converges to zero by consistency, and hence this last product term in the denominator converges to zero in probability. Together, these bounds imply \\[\\sqrt{n}(\\hat\\theta_n - \\theta^\\star)\\rightarrow N(0,I(\\theta^\\star)^{-1}).\\] The formal support for this last claim is provided by Slutskys Theorem which well not cover here. We also used consistency in this proof sketch which we havent shown. This latter result provides the additional and stronger properties of asymptotic unbiasedness, efficiency, and normality.

Denote the sample mean by \\(\\overline X_n = n^{-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\\). According to the Central Limit Theorem, \\[\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}} \\stackrel{i.d.}{\\rightarrow} N(0,1)\\] for large sample size, meaning the distribution of the centered and scaled (standardized) sample mean converges to standard normal. Therefore, for large sample sizes, \\[\\overline X_n \\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim} N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\] We say the approximate/large-sample sampling distribution of the sample mean is Normal. If \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) constitutes a random sample from a Normal population, then the sampling distribution of the sample mean is exactly normal: \\[\\overline X_n \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2/n)\\quad \\text{for all }n,\\] which can be verified using MGFs. How large is large? For many disributions the CLT will kick in for modest sample size, even, say, \\(n=50\\) is often sufficient. But, ultimately, the number of samples needed in order for the sample mean to be nearly normally distributed depends on the underlying distribution. Very skewed or multimodal distributions may resist the CLT much longer than distributions that already are close to normal. Below is a quick Monte Carlo experiment illustrating the CLT, and sample mean sampling distribution, for two distributions: exponential and log-normal. As a final reminder, note the CLT does not apply to heavy-tailed distributions that lack a mean. For example, the Cauchy distribution is very likely to produce extreme values, and, as a result, it has no finite mean. Therefore, the CLT does not apply and its unclear what will be the sampling distribution of its sample mean. It turns out the sample mean is still Cauchy-distributedtaking the average of Cauchy samples does not reduce uncertainty at all. For an illustration, see the Monte-Carlo-approximated distribution of the sample mean of 50 samples from a Cauchy population: 4.2 Sample Variance Let \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) denote a random sample from a Normal population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\). Denote the sample variance by \\(S^2_n = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline X_n)^2\\). Next, we will discover the sampling distribution of the (normal) sample variance. First, we need to establish the fact that if \\(Z\\sim N(0,1)\\), then \\(Z^2\\) has what is called a Chi-squared distribution, with one degree of freedomthis is the parameter of this distribution. This Chi-squared distribution has MGF \\(\\left(1-2t\\right)^{-k/2}\\) where \\(k\\) is the degrees of freedom parameter. Its corresponding density function is \\[f(x) = 2^{-k/2}\\left[\\Gamma(k/2)\\right]^{-1}x^{k/2-1}e^{-x/2},\\quad x&gt;0\\] and you might recognize this as a Gamma distribution with shape \\(k/2\\) and rate \\(1/2\\), so its mean is \\((k/2)/(1/2) = k\\). Ww can establish this fact by the MGF technique. Evaluate the MGF of \\(Z^2\\) as follows: \\[\\begin{align*} M_{Z^2}(t) &amp;= E(e^{tZ^2}) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{tz^2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\tfrac12 z^2}dz\\\\ &amp; = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\frac{1}{1-2t}}z^2}dz\\\\ &amp; = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1-2t}}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi\\frac{1}{1-2t}}} e^{-\\frac{1}{2\\frac{1}{1-2t}}z^2}dz\\\\ &amp; = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{1-2t}} \\end{align*}\\] where the last inequality follows from the fact the integrand is a normal density function with mean zero and variance \\(\\frac{1}{1-2t}\\) (provided \\(t&lt;2\\)) so that the integral equals one. This shows \\(Z^2\\) is Chi-squared distributed with \\(1\\) degree of freedom. As weve many times, the MGF argument works particularly well with sums of independent random variables. If \\(Z_1, Z_2, \\ldots, Z_n\\) are iid standard normal, then \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2\\) is Chi-squared distributed with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom. To show this, simply show the MGF of \\(\\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2\\) equals \\(\\left(1-2t\\right)^{-n/2}\\) using the previous result for \\(n=1\\), the definition of the MGF, and independence. Next, well show a linear transformation of the the sample variance has a Chi-squared distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Start by making the linear transformation \\[\\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\sigma^2} = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\right)^2.\\] Heres the main trick: add and subtract \\(\\mu\\) inside the square in the sum, then expand the square and simplify: \\[\\begin{align*} \\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\sigma^2} &amp;= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu + \\mu - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 + 2\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\right) + \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{\\mu - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 - 2n\\left(\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 + n\\left(\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 - n\\left(\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2\\\\ &amp; = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2 \\end{align*}\\] So far, we have shown \\[\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(\\frac{X_i - \\mu}{\\sigma}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}}\\right)^2.\\] The first term on the right hand side is a summation of \\(n\\) squares of independent, standard normal r.v.s \\(Z_i = \\frac{X_i - \\overline X_n}{\\sigma}\\). Baed on our previous result, this sum must be distributed as Chi-squared with \\(n\\) degrees of freedom. The second term on the right is also the square of a standard normal random variable, so it must be distributed as Chi-squared with one degree of freedom. Consequently, the sum on the left hand side must be a Chi-squared random variable with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. 4.2.1 Large-sample sampling distribution of sample variance If \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) is a random sample from a distribution with at least 4 finite moments, then the sample variance \\(S_n^2\\) is approximately normally distributed for large \\(n\\). To see this, note \\[S_n^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline X_n)^2 \\approx \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i\\] where \\(Z_i = (X_i - \\mu)^2\\). The latter expression is a sample average of iid random variables, and, as such, the CLT implies (the centered and scaled transformation of) it has a limiting normal distribution. This reasoning can be made rigorous. 4.3 Sampling distribution of studentized sample mean Let \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample from a normal population with mean \\(\\mu\\) and variance \\(\\sigma^2\\); and, let \\(\\overline X_n\\) and \\(S_n^2\\) denote the sample mean and sample variance, respectively. Let \\[T_n:=\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sqrt{S_n^2 / n}}\\] denote the studentized sample mean. \\(T_n\\) is the standardized sample mean\\(\\overline X_n\\) minus \\(\\mu\\) and divided by \\(\\sqrt{\\sigma^2/n}\\)with the true variance replaced by its estimate, the sample variance. The standardized sample mean has a standard normal distribution (even approximately so for non-normal random samples by the CLT), but the studentized sample mean is not normally-distributed. Rather, the studentized sample mean has a Students \\(t\\) distribution with \\((n-1)\\) degrees of freedom. A Students \\(t\\) random variable is defined in the following way: If \\(Z\\) is standard normal and independent of \\(V \\sim\\) Chi-Squared \\((n-1)\\), then \\[T:=\\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{V/(n-1)}}\\] is a Students \\(t\\) random variable with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom. Rewriting the studentized sample mean, we have \\[T_n = \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sqrt{S_n^2 / n}} = \\frac{\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sqrt{\\sigma^2 / n}}}{\\sqrt{(n-1)S_n^2/\\{(n-1)\\sigma^2\\}}} = \\frac{Z}{\\sqrt{V/(n-1)}}.\\] It remains to verify \\(\\overline X_n\\) and \\(S_n^2\\) are independent, and a sketch of this result is given next. 4.3.1 Part of Students Theorem - Indepndence of \\(\\overline X_n\\) and \\(S_n^2\\) Let \\(Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n\\) be a random sample of standard normal random variables. Without loss of generality lets sketch a proof that \\(\\overline Z_n\\) and \\(W = \\sum_{i=1}^n (Z_i - \\overline Z_n)^2\\) are independent. Define the matrix \\(O_n\\) to be the \\(n\\times n\\) matrix with entries defined by: \\[For 1 \\leq i \\leq n-1, \\quad o_{ij} = \\Bigg\\{ \\begin{matrix} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i(i+1)}}, &amp;j\\leq i \\\\ -\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{i(i+1)}}, &amp;j= i+1 \\end{matrix}\\] and zero otherwise; except that \\(o_{nj} = n^{-1/2}\\). Then, it can be checked that \\(O_n\\) is orthogonal, i.e., \\(O_n^\\top O_n = I_n\\), the identity. Next, define the vectors \\(Z = (Z_1, \\ldots, Z_n)^\\top\\) and \\(Y = O_n Z\\). By construction of \\(O_n\\) we have \\[Y^\\top Y = Z^\\top O_n^\\top O_n Z = Z^\\top Z = \\sum_{i=1}^n Z_i^2.\\] And, we also have \\[Y_n = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{Z_i}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\sqrt{n} \\overline Z_n.\\] Therefore, \\[\\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}Y_i^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_i^2 - Y_n^2 = Z^\\top Z - n\\overline Z_n^2 = W.\\] So far, we have shown \\(\\overline Z_n\\) is a function of \\(Y_n\\) and \\(W\\) is a function of \\(Y_1, \\ldots, Y_{n-1}\\). But, \\(Y = O_n Z\\) is normally distributed with covariance \\(O_n^\\top O_n = I_n\\). Therefore, \\(Y_i\\), \\(i=1, \\ldots, n\\), are independent, which implies \\(\\overline Z_n\\) and \\(W\\) are independent. 4.4 Differences of Sample Means So far we have considered statistics baed on a single random sample. Now, well consider statistics based on separate random samples from two populations. First, consider a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{n}\\) from a normal distribution with mean and variance \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and another random sample \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_m\\) from a different normal distribution with mean and variance \\(\\mu_Y\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\). 4.4.1 Standarized difference The standardized difference of means is given by \\[Z = \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\overline Y_m - (\\mu_X - \\mu_Y)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_X^2}{n} + \\frac{\\sigma_Y^2}{m}}}\\] and follows a standard normal distribution. 4.4.2 Studentized difference, equal variances Suppose \\(\\sigma_X^2 = \\sigma_Y^2\\), and define the pooled sample variance \\(S_P^2 = \\frac{(n-1)S_X^2 + (m-1)S_Y^2}{n+m-2}\\). The studentized difference of sample means is defined by \\[T = \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\overline Y_m - (\\mu_X - \\mu_Y)}{\\sqrt{S_p^2(\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{1}{m})}}\\] follows a Students \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n+m - 2\\) degrees of freedom. 4.4.3 Studentized difference, unequal variances When the population variances are unequal a different version of the studentized difference of means is sometimes used: \\[T = \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\overline Y_m - (\\mu_X - \\mu_Y)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}}}.\\] This difference does not have an exact \\(t\\) distribution, but can be approximated well by a \\(t\\) distribution with degrees of freedom given by Satterthwaites formula: \\[df = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\\right)^2}{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(\\frac{S_X^2}{n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\left(\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\\right)^2}.\\] Since the degrees of freedom is an integer-valued parameter the result of this formula is rounded down to the nearest integer. 4.5 Ratios of Sample Variances As above, consider a random sample \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_{n}\\) from a normal distribution with mean and variance \\(\\mu_X\\) and \\(\\sigma_X^2\\) and another random sample \\(Y_1, Y_2, \\ldots, Y_m\\) from a different normal distribution with mean and variance \\(\\mu_Y\\) and \\(\\sigma_Y^2\\). If \\(U\\sim\\) Chi-Squared with df \\(n-1\\) and \\(V\\sim\\) Chi-Squared with df \\(m-1\\) and \\(U\\) and \\(V\\) are independent, then \\[F := \\frac{U/(n-1)}{V/(m-1)}\\] has an F distribution with two degrees of freedom parameters \\(df1 = n-1\\) and \\(df2 = m-1\\), often called the numerator and denominator degrees of freedom. If \\(S_X^2\\) and \\(S_Y^2\\) are sample variances, then \\[\\frac{\\frac{(n-1)S_X^2}{\\sigma_X^2(n-1)}}{\\frac{(m-1)S_Y^2}{\\sigma_Y^2(m-1)}} = \\frac{S_X^2/\\sigma_X^2}{S_Y^2/\\sigma_Y^2}\\] has an \\(F(n-1, m-1)\\) distribution.

Point estimators, like the sample mean, certainly help to describe features of the population. But, the trouble with point estimators is that, on their own, they provide no sense of uncertainty. On one hand, a point estimator is just one number, and one number seems very precise. So, in a sort of psychological sense (and Im being very loose with that term) people may feel a false sense of certainty about a point estimate. For example, if I say ``the sample mean is 5 someone could very reasonably expect the population mean is quite close to 5, but, given a little intuition, that persons opinion may change quite a bit depending on whether the sample size is, say, 10 or 100. On the other hand, in a mathematical statistical sense, we know an estimator is a random variable with a distribution that, usually, has a finite variance. And, if known, we could use knowledge of that distribution to quantify the variability (read uncertainty) inherent in the estimator. So, besides the point estimate itself, it would be helpful to report some measure of variability of the estimate to give the user a more informed view of the estimate of the population mean (or other feature being estimated). One way to include information of the uncertainty of a point estimate is to include an estimate of the estimators standard deviationthis is usually called a standard error. For example, the sample mean \\(\\overline X_n\\) estimates the population mean \\(\\mu\\) and if the population has a finite variance \\(\\sigma^2\\) then the standard deviation of \\(\\overline X_n\\) is \\(\\sigma/\\sqrt{n}\\). Usually, \\(\\sigma^2\\) is unknown, so it is replaced by a point estimate, say, the usual sample variance \\(S_n^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \\overline X_n)^2\\) to get the standard error \\(\\sqrt{S_n^2/n}\\). A common practice is to report the estimate \\(\\overline x_n\\) along with the standard error \\(s_n/\\sqrt{n}\\). One drawback of reporting an estimate and its standard deviation is that its not clear how much variability one standard deviation really represents; it depends on the sampling distribution of the estimator. For example, if an estimator is normally distributed then an interval of one standard deviation about its mean contains about \\(68\\%\\) of the distribution, and see the figure below. One the other hand, suppose an estimator has a Chi-squared distribution with \\(5\\) degrees of freedom. Then an interval of radius one standard deviation about its mean contains about \\(72\\%\\) of the distribution. The point is that one standard deviation does not provide an objective summary of uncertainty across different distributions. To remedy this issue of the vagueness of standard deviation/standard error we introduce the concept of a confidence interval. An interval-valued estimate is an interval or range of values representing a set that may plausibly contain the true parameter value. Lets denote this interval by \\((\\ell, u)\\), its lower and upper bounds. Then, a reasonable way to define the endpoints is to select them so that the interval has the confidence property \\[P(\\ell \\leq \\theta \\leq u) = 1-\\alpha\\] where \\(\\theta\\) is the true parameter value and \\(\\alpha \\in (0,1)\\) is up to the user to decideusually \\(\\alpha\\) is near zero. The probability statement is with respect to \\(\\ell\\) and \\(u\\), meaning these endpoints are random variablesin particular, they should be statistics, i.e., depended on the data. Then, a confidence interval is a random interval with a prescribed chance of catching the true parameter. 5.2 Normal population mean example Suppose \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) is a random sample from \\(N(\\mu, 1)\\). Lets find a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence interval (CI) for \\(\\mu\\). Since \\(\\overline X_n\\) is a great estimator of \\(\\mu\\) it makes sense the endpoints of the interval would depend on \\(\\overline X_n\\). The confidence interval is supposed to be a range of plausible values of \\(\\mu\\); and, \\(\\overline X_n\\) seems the most plausible, so the interval ought to look like \\((\\overline X_n - c_1, \\, \\overline X_n + c_2)\\); in other words, the interval is the sample mean plus or minus something extra. We known \\(\\overline X_n \\sim N(\\mu, 1/n)\\), which is a symmetric distribution. So, it would make sense for our \\(\\pm \\text{ something extra}\\) to be symmetric, i.e. the interval should have the form \\((\\overline X_n - c, \\overline X_n + c)\\) for some \\(c&gt;0\\). Now, it just remains to specify \\(c\\) such that the interval has the confidence property. We want \\[P(\\overline X_n - c \\leq \\mu \\leq \\overline X_n +c) = 1-\\alpha.\\] Subtract \\(\\overline X_n\\) and standardize to get the standard normal probability \\[P\\left(-\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}} \\leq \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{1/\\sqrt{n}} \\leq \\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1-\\alpha\\] \\[P\\left(-\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}} \\leq Z \\leq \\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1-\\alpha.\\] This means \\(P(Z\\leq \\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}) = 1-\\alpha/2\\) by symmetry of the standard normal distribution. In other words, \\(\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}\\) is the value such that \\[1-\\alpha/2=F_Z(\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}})=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}e^{-\\frac{1}{2}z^2}dz.\\] This defines \\(\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}}\\) as the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) standard normal quantile. Given a choice of \\(\\alpha\\) its not easy to solve for \\(c\\) in the above (integral) equation, but we can use the built-in R function qnorm to find this value. Let \\(\\alpha = 0.025\\), for example, so that the probability our interval contains \\(\\mu\\) is \\(95\\%\\). Then, \\(\\frac{c}{1/\\sqrt{n}} = qnorm(0.975) = 1.96\\) and \\(c = 1.96\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\). Conclude a \\(95\\%\\) CI for \\(\\mu\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline X_n - 1.96\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\,\\overline X_n - 1.96\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\\] More generally, if we denote the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) quantile of the standard normal by \\(z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\) then \\[\\left(\\overline X_n - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\,\\overline X_n - z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] defines a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for \\(\\mu\\). Remark: Its not essential that the above CI (or any CI) is symmetric about a point estimator, but when the sampling distribution of the estimator is symmetric this is the best choice. To see this, note that \\[\\left(\\overline X_n - z_{1-\\alpha/3}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}, \\,\\overline X_n - z_{1-2\\alpha/3}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right)\\] is also a \\(95\\%\\) CI for \\(\\mu\\), but it is always larger (wider) than the symmetric interval. So, the symmetric interval, which being shorter is more precise, is preferable. 5.3 Other Exact CIs for normal population mean and variance parameters 5.3.1 Population mean, unknown variance Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample of size \\(n\\geq 2\\) from \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) where both mean and variance parameters are unknown. We know the studentized mean follows a Students \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom: \\[T = \\frac{\\overline X_n - \\mu}{\\sqrt{S_n^2/n}}\\sim t(n-1).\\] Mirroring the argument from above when \\(\\sigma^2\\) is a known value, we assume a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for \\(\\mu\\) would be symmetric about \\(\\overline X_n\\) with radius \\(t_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1) \\frac{S_n}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) where \\(t_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1)\\) is the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) quantile of the Students \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n-1\\) degrees of freedom: \\[P\\left(\\overline X_n - t_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1) \\frac{S_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\leq \\mu \\leq \\overline X_n + t_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1) \\frac{S_n}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right) = 1-\\alpha.\\] 5.3.2 Population variance, unknown mean Let \\(X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\) be a random sample of size \\(n\\geq 2\\) from \\(N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) where both mean and variance parameters are unknown. We know the following transformation is Chi-squared distributed: \\[\\frac{(n-1)S_n^2)}{\\sigma^2}\\sim \\chi^2(n-1).\\] Now, the Chi-squared distribution is not symmetricits skewed. There are a number of ways to define a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for \\(\\sigma^2\\) based on the above sampling distribution. Since \\(\\sigma^2 &gt; 0\\) we can define a one-sided interval starting from zero: \\[\\left(0, \\, \\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha}(n-1)}\\right)\\] where \\(\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha}(n-1)\\) is the \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\) quantile of a Chi-squared r.v. with \\((n-1)\\) degrees of freedom. Then, \\[\\begin{align*} P(0 \\leq \\sigma^2 \\leq \\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha}(n-1)}) &amp;= P(0\\leq \\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\sigma^2} \\leq \\chi^2_{1-\\alpha}(n-1))\\\\ &amp; = P(\\chi^2(n-1) \\geq \\chi^2_{\\alpha}(n-1))\\\\ &amp;= 1-\\alpha \\end{align*}\\] by definition of the quantile. We can define two-sided intervals as well. The equi-tailed interval is not the shortest possible interval, but it has a simple form: \\[\\left(\\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\chi^2_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1)}, \\, \\frac{(n-1)S_n^2}{\\chi^2_{\\alpha/2}(n-1)}\\right).\\] In order to find the shortest possible \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI one could draw a horizontal line slicing across the Chi-squared density such that the area under both the line and the density equals \\(\\alpha\\). Then, the intersection points of the line and the density would give the lower and upper Chi-squared quantiles to use in the two-sided interval. Since the density is not symmetric this interval generally would not be based on the \\(1-\\alpha/2\\) and \\(\\alpha/2\\) quantiles like the equi-tailed interval. For example, the shortest \\(95\\%\\) CI when \\(df=10\\) is based on quantile values of about 1.284 and 25.05. The following plot illustrates this. ## 0.04998856 with absolute error &lt; 8.5e-05 ## [1] 0.001862438 ## [1] 0.001863508 5.3.3 Two normal samples, comparing means Lets tackle the next topic by way of an example. Suppose infant walking time  the age in months at which babies can walk on their own  is normally distributed. Generally, parents are excited for their infants to begin walking and some parents take steps to encourage their infants to walk. Well assume it is reasonable to model the population of infant walking times among those infants whose parents no not intervene in walking skills development as a random sample from a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_x\\) and variance \\(sigma_x^2\\); likewise we model the corresponding population of infant walking times influenced by parent behavior by a normal distribution with mean \\(\\mu_y\\) and variance \\(sigma_y^2\\). Assume this parental influence factor represents a more-or-less standard treatment; for example, parents might spend 60 minutes a day encouraging their infant to crawl and stand with assistance or play in a bounce seat to build lower body strength. Child development researchers would be interested to know whether such parental interventions influence infant walking times. Given observations from an experiment comparing these two groups of infants, how would we answer the researchers question? One answer comes in the form of a CI for the difference of means \\(\\mu_x - \\mu_y\\). In this case a negative difference indicates some impact of parental involvement. And, if a \\(95\\%\\) CI does not contain zero, then the CI reflects strong evidence in the data that the true means are different. Based on our knowledge of sampling distributions we know that if \\(\\sigma_x^2 = \\sigma_y^2\\) the following statistic has a Students \\(t\\) distribution with \\(n+m-2\\) df where \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are the sample sizes in each group: \\[\\frac{\\overline X - \\overline Y - (\\mu_x - \\mu_y)}{\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}}\\] where \\(S_p^2\\) denotes the pooled (sample-size weighted average) sample variance. As a result, the following probability statement is exact: \\[\\begin{align*} 1-\\alpha &amp; = P\\left(t_{\\alpha/2, n+m-2} \\leq \\frac{\\overline X - \\overline Y - (\\mu_x - \\mu_y)}{\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}} \\leq t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\right)\\\\ &amp; = P\\left(t_{\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\leq \\overline X - \\overline Y - (\\mu_x - \\mu_y) \\leq t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\right)\\\\ &amp; = P\\left(-(\\overline X - \\overline Y)+t_{\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\leq - (\\mu_x - \\mu_y) \\leq -(\\overline X - \\overline Y)+ t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\right)\\\\ &amp; = P\\left((\\overline X - \\overline Y)-t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\leq (\\mu_x - \\mu_y) \\leq (\\overline X - \\overline Y)+ t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\right) \\end{align*}\\] where the last line follows from multiplying by \\(-1\\) and noting \\(t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2} = -t_{\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\) by symmetry. Therefore, a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for the difference of means \\(\\mu_x - \\mu_y\\) is given by \\[\\left((\\overline X - \\overline Y)-t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}, \\, (\\overline X - \\overline Y)+t_{1-\\alpha/2, n+m-2}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{1}{n} + \\frac{1}{m}\\right)}\\right).\\] Suppose we conduct the infant walking time experiment and observe the following data: \\[X:\\,\\,\\, 13.2\\,\\,\\, 16.6\\,\\,\\, 16.7\\,\\,\\, 16.8\\,\\,\\, 17.0\\,\\,\\, 17.1\\,\\,\\, 17.3\\,\\,\\, 17.4\\,\\,\\, 17.4\\,\\,\\, 17.7\\,\\,\\, 17.9 \\] \\[Y: \\,\\,\\, 16.8\\,\\,\\, 17.1\\,\\,\\, 17.6\\,\\,\\, 17.7\\,\\,\\, 18.8\\,\\,\\, 18.8\\,\\,\\, 19.3\\,\\,\\, 19.6\\,\\,\\, 21.0\\,\\,\\, 21.2\\,\\,\\, 21.5\\,\\,\\, 22.1\\,\\,\\, 22.8\\] Computing the sample statistics we find \\(\\overline x = 16.83\\), \\(\\overline y = 19.56\\), \\(s_x^2 = 1.61\\), and \\(s_y^2 = 3.97\\). The pooled sample variance is \\((10s_x^2+12s_y^2)/22 = 2.90\\). The \\(0.975\\) quantile of the Students \\(t\\) distribution with 22 df can be found using qt(0.975, 22) and equals about 2.07. Plugging all these values into the CI formula, the \\(95\\%\\) CI for the difference in mean infant walking times is \\[(-4.18, \\, -1.29)\\] We conclude the mean infant walking times in the group with parental intervention were between about 1.3 and 4.2 months shorter than in the non-intervention group. (Note this is made-up data only for illustration purposes.) The careful reader may be concerned that our CI method used above relies on the two normal populations having identical variances but our sample variances are substantially different. This equal-variance CI procedure is often referred to as Studentss two-sample CI, in contrast to an alternative method that can be used when variances are unequal called Welchs two-sample CI. Recall the studentized difference of sample means when variances are unequal approximately (not exactly) follows a Students \\(t\\) distribution with Satterthwaites choice of degrees of freedom: \\[\\frac{\\overline X_n - \\overline Y_m - (\\mu_X - \\mu_Y)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}}}\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim}t(\\nu)\\] where \\[\\nu = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{S_X^2}{n}+\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\\right)^2}{\\frac{1}{n-1}\\left(\\frac{S_X^2}{n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{m-1}\\left(\\frac{S_Y^2}{m}\\right)^2}.\\] Following the same argument as above, this implies an approximate \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for the difference of means is given by \\[\\left((\\overline X - \\overline Y)-t_{1-\\alpha/2, \\nu}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{S_x^2}{n} + \\frac{S_y^2}{m}\\right)}, \\, (\\overline X - \\overline Y)+t_{1-\\alpha/2, \\nu}\\sqrt{S_p^2\\left(\\frac{S_x^2}{n} + \\frac{S_y^2}{m}\\right)}\\right).\\] Plugging in the relevant sample statistics, we get \\(\\nu = 20\\) so that we use the quantile \\(t_{0.975}(20) = 2.086\\). Welchs two-sample approximate \\(95\\%\\) interval is \\[(-4.14, \\,-1.33)\\] which is hardly different than Students interval. Well investigate the comparative performances of these two intervals further in lab. 5.3.4 Two normal samples, comparing variances In some applications it is either more important or at least of equal importance to compare population variances rather than means. For example, consider one or more manufacturing processes for producing optical lensesthese might be for glasses or contacts. Lenses have many dimensional quantities that determine their properties, for example, the refraction index of the lens material and the thickness of the lens, which both contribute to the power of the lens. Suppose a manufacturing process is supposed to produce a lens of a given thickness. A small tolerance is allowable but any lenses produced with thickness outside the tolerance must be rejected. We can think of the difference between the specified, target lens thickness and the population mean thickness of lenses produced by a specific process as bias. Then, our preference between two or more production processes is a question about bias-variance tradeoff. A production process with no bias but a high variance in lens thickness will result in many lenses being rejectedperhaps even more than a manufacturing process that produces biased lenses with very low variability in thickness. Clearly, for choosing between processes we need to evaluate both process bias and process variance. For comparing two process variances (where the underlying popualtions are normal) we use a ratio statistic. The sampling distribution of the following ratio of sample variances has an F distribution when the population variances are equal: \\[\\frac{S_x^2}{S_y^2} \\sim F(n-1, m-1).\\] Recall that \\((n-1)S_x^2/\\sigma_x^2 \\sim\\) Chi-squared\\((n-1)\\) and \\((m-1)S_y^2/\\sigma_y^2 \\sim\\) Chi-squared\\((m-1)\\). The ratio of two independent, Chi-squared r.v.s divided by the dfs defines an F random variable with two parameters which are the degrees of freedom of the numerator and denominator Chi-squared r.v.s. When \\(\\sigma_x^2 = \\sigma_y^2\\), we have \\[\\frac{\\frac{(n-1)S_x^2}{\\sigma_x^2(n-1)}}{\\frac{(m-1)S_y^2}{\\sigma_y^2(m-1)}} = \\frac{\\frac{(n-1)S_x^2}{(n-1)}}{\\frac{(m-1)S_y^2}{(m-1)}} = \\frac{\\text{Chi-squared(n-1)/(n-1)}}{\\text{Chi-squared(m-1)/(m-1)}} = \\frac{S_x^2}{S_y^2} = F(n-1, m-1).\\] And, when the variances are not equal, we simply have \\[\\frac{S_x^2 \\sigma_y^2}{S_y^2 \\sigma_x^2} \\sim F(n-1, m-1).\\] We can invert this relationship to find a CI for \\(\\sigma_y^2 / \\sigma_x^2\\) using the following probability computation: \\[\\begin{align*} 1-\\alpha &amp; = P(F_{\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1) \\leq \\frac{S_x^2 \\sigma_y^2}{S_y^2 \\sigma_x^2} \\leq F_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1))\\\\ &amp; = P(\\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}F_{\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1) \\leq \\sigma_y^2/\\sigma_x^2 \\leq \\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}F_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1))\\\\ &amp; = P(\\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}\\frac{1}{F_{1-\\alpha/2}(m-1, n-1)} \\leq \\sigma_y^2/\\sigma_x^2 \\leq \\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}F_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1)), \\end{align*}\\] where the last line uses a reciprocal-equality property of F distributions with swapped degrees of freedom, namely \\(F_{\\alpha}(df1, df2) = 1/(F_{1-\\alpha}(df2, df1))\\). This is not essential if you are using R to compute F quantiles but is helpful for using F tables, which typically only list upper tail quantiles. Then, a \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for the ratio \\(\\sigma_y^2/\\sigma_x^2\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}\\frac{1}{F_{1-\\alpha/2}(m-1, n-1)}, \\,\\frac{S_y^2}{S_x^2}F_{1-\\alpha/2}(n-1, m-1)\\right).\\] Given the following observations (in nanometers) of lens thickness using two different production methods, compute \\(95\\%\\) CIs for the difference in means (use Welchs method) and the ratio of variances: \\[X: 2.9859\\,\\,\\, 3.0042\\,\\,\\, 3.0055 \\,\\,\\,3.0083 \\,\\,\\,3.0113 \\,\\,\\,3.0124\\,\\,\\, 3.0150\\,\\,\\, 3.0214\\] \\[Y: 2.9964\\,\\,\\, 3.0011 \\,\\,\\,3.0099\\,\\,\\, 3.0110\\,\\,\\, 3.0124\\,\\,\\, 3.0130\\,\\,\\, 3.0140\\,\\,\\, 3.0205\\] The \\(95\\%\\) CI for the difference in population mean thicknesses is \\[(-0.0116, \\, 0.0080).\\] The \\(95\\%\\) CI for the ratio of population variances \\(\\sigma_y^2/\\sigma_x^2\\) is \\[(0.1058, \\, 2.6394).\\] 5.4 CIs for proportions 5.4.1 A single Bernoulli proportion Using the DeMoivre-Laplace CLT we know the standardized sample proportion is approximately normally distributed: \\[\\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim}N(0,1)\\] Then, again denoting lower standard normal quantiles by \\(z_\\alpha\\), we have \\[1-\\alpha \\approx P\\left(z_{\\alpha/2} \\leq \\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}\\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\right).\\] As in other cases covered above, we can derive an approximate CI for \\(p\\) by algebraic manipulations within the probability statement. A complicating factor is that the true proportion \\(p\\) shows up in both the numerator and denominator of the standardized sample proportion. A common technique to get around this is to replace the standard deviation of \\(\\hat p\\) by the estimated standard deviation \\(\\sqrt{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)/n}\\). Using the estimated standard deviation, an approximate \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) CI for \\(p\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\hat p + z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}, \\, \\hat p + z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p(1-\\hat p)}{n}}\\right).\\] It is possible to derive a CI for \\(p\\) without resorting to using the estimated standard deviation. In that case, we have to solve for \\(p\\) in the quadratic equation \\[\\frac{\\hat p - p}{\\sqrt{\\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}}= z_{1-\\alpha/2}.\\] The endpoints of the CI based on the true standard deviation of \\(\\hat p\\) are given by \\[\\frac{n\\hat p + 0.5z_{\\alpha/2}^2\\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{n\\hat p(1-\\hat p)+0.25z_{\\alpha/2}^2}}{n+z_{\\alpha/2}^2}.\\] Example: A survey is conducted to determine the level of support for the construction of a new nuclear power plant in a community. 140 of 400 randomly sampled voters favor the construction project. Find a \\(99\\%\\) approximate CI for the true proportion of voters favoring the project. The sample proportion is \\(\\hat p = 0.35\\) and the estimated standard deviation of \\(\\hat p\\) is \\(\\sqrt{0.35\\cdot 0.65 / 400} = 0.02384848\\). Given \\(z_{0.995} = 2.575\\) an approximate \\(99\\%\\) CI for p is given by \\[(28.86\\%, \\, 41.14\\%).\\] Alternatively, using the formula for the CI based on the true standard deviation of \\(\\hat p\\) we find the interval \\[(29.15\\%, \\, 41.34\\%).\\] 5.4.2 Difference of two Bernoulli proportions The most common experiments compare two or more populations. For two Bernoulli populations an approximate CI for the difference of population proportions can be computed based on the DeMoivre-Laplace CLT similarly to the single population interval above based on the estimated standard deviation of the sample proportion. Our CI for the difference of proportions is given by \\[\\left(\\hat p_1 - \\hat p_2 + z_{\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p_1(1-\\hat p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat p_2(1-\\hat p_2)}{n_2}}, \\,\\,\\,\\,\\, \\hat p_1 - \\hat p_2 + z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\hat p_1(1-\\hat p_1)}{n_1} + \\frac{\\hat p_2(1-\\hat p_2)}{n_2}}\\right).\\] Example: Suppose a poll of Illinois voters finds 132 of 200 male voters and 90 of 150 female voters favor a certain candidate. A \\(99\\%\\) CI for the difference of population favorability proportions between the sexes is \\[(-7.4\\%, \\, 19.4\\%)\\] indicating there is, plausibly, no difference in the candidates favorability between the sexes. 5.5 Approximate CIs based on MLEs So far we have derived CIs for parameters based on sampling distributions of statistics used to estimate those parameters. We can use the same strategy to derive CIs for parameters estimated using maximum likelihood whenever asymptotic normality of the corresponding MLE is justified. Recall there are a few cases where asymptotic normality may not hold, such as estimating the lower or upper bounds of a uniform distributionthat case violates the condition that the sample space does not depend on the parameter. However, in many situations asymptotic normality of the MLE does hold, and we can use it to derive approximate CIs. Recall that, under some regularity conditions, the MLE \\(\\hat\\theta\\) for the scalar parameter \\(\\theta\\) is approximately normally distributed with mean \\(\\theta\\) and variance \\([nI(\\theta)]^{-1}\\) where \\(I(\\theta)\\) is the Fisher information for one sample. If we replace the variance by the estimated variance by plugging in \\(\\hat\\theta\\) then we obtain the CI \\[\\left(\\hat\\theta \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}[nI(\\hat\\theta)]^{-1/2}\\right),\\] where youll recall that \\(I(\\theta) = E\\left[\\left(\\frac{\\partial \\ell}{\\partial \\theta}\\right)^2\\right]\\) or, equivalently (most of the time), \\(I(\\theta) = -E\\left(\\frac{\\partial^2 \\ell}{\\partial \\theta^2}\\right)\\) where \\(\\ell\\) denotes the loglikelihood function. Example: The MLE of the exponential rate parameter is \\(\\hat\\theta = \\overline X\\). We have previously found \\([nI(\\theta)]^{-1/2} = \\sqrt{(\\overline X)^2/n}\\) so that an MLE-based approximate CI for the exponential rate \\(\\theta\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline X \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\frac{\\overline X}{\\sqrt{n}}\\right).\\] 5.5.1 Multivariate case When \\(\\theta\\) is a vector parameter the MLE \\(\\hat\\theta\\) is approximately distributed as a multivariate normal random vector with mean vector \\(\\theta\\) and (estimated) covariance matrix \\([nI(\\hat\\theta)]^{-1}\\). We can compute approximate CIs for each element of \\(\\theta\\) using the marginal approximate normal distributions of the elements of \\(\\hat\\theta\\) as in the scalar case. However, we can also compute a joint confidence region for two or more elements of \\(\\theta\\). The elliptical region \\[\\{\\theta: (\\hat \\theta - \\theta)[nI(\\hat\\theta)]^{-1}(\\hat \\theta - \\theta)^\\top \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}^2\\}\\] is an approximate \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) confidence region for \\(\\theta\\). It is also smaller than the set product of marginal confidence intervals, which is a hyper-rectangle containing this ellipse. Example: The MLEs for a normal population mean and variance have approximate normal distribution \\[(\\overline X, \\hat\\sigma^2) \\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim}N\\left((\\mu, \\sigma^2), \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma^2/n &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 2\\sigma^4/n \\end{bmatrix}\\right).\\] An approximate \\(100(1-\\alpha)\\%\\) elliptical confidence region for \\((\\mu, \\sigma^2)\\) is given by \\[\\{(\\mu, \\sigma^2): (\\overline X - \\mu, \\hat\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2)\\begin{bmatrix} \\hat\\sigma^2/n &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 2\\hat\\sigma^4/n \\end{bmatrix}^{-1} (\\overline X - \\mu, \\hat\\sigma^2 - \\sigma^2)^\\top \\leq z_{1-\\alpha/2}^2\\}.\\] set.seed(56482) data &lt;- rnorm(20, 5, 3) xbar &lt;- mean(data) s2 &lt;- var(data)*(19)/20 xc &lt;- xbar # center x_c or h yc &lt;- s2 # y_c or k a &lt;- 1.96*sqrt(s2/20) # major axis length b &lt;- 1.96*sqrt(2*(s2^2)/20) # minor axis length phi &lt;- 0 # angle of major axis with x axis phi or tau t &lt;- seq(0, 2*pi, 0.01) x &lt;- xc + a*cos(t)*cos(phi) - b*sin(t)*sin(phi) y &lt;- yc + a*cos(t)*sin(phi) + b*sin(t)*cos(phi) plot(x,y, col=&#39;blue&#39;, type = &#39;l&#39;, xlim = c(3,7), ylim = c(2,15)) CI.mu &lt;- c(xbar - 1.96*sqrt(s2/20), xbar + 1.96*sqrt(s2/20)) CI.sig2 &lt;- c(s2 - 1.96*sqrt(2*(s2^2)/20), s2 + 1.96*sqrt(2*(s2^2)/20)) lines(c(CI.mu[1], CI.mu[2]),c(CI.sig2[1], CI.sig2[1]), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(c(CI.mu[1], CI.mu[2]),c(CI.sig2[2], CI.sig2[2]), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(c(CI.mu[1], CI.mu[1]),c(CI.sig2[1], CI.sig2[2]), col = &#39;red&#39;) lines(c(CI.mu[2], CI.mu[2]),c(CI.sig2[1], CI.sig2[2]), col = &#39;red&#39;) 5.5.2 The Delta method The delta theorem says that asymptotic normality of the MLE is preserved under smooth (differentiable) transformations. Let \\(g(\\cdot)\\) be a differentiable function. Then, \\[\\sqrt{n}(g(\\hat\\theta) - g(\\theta))\\stackrel{\\cdot}{\\sim} N\\left(0, [g&#39;(\\theta)]^\\top I(\\theta)^{-1}g&#39;(\\theta)\\right).\\] The power of the delta theorem is its implied method for constructing CIs for any nice function of population parameters. Example: For a normal population experiment a common function of parameters that is of interest to researchers is the so-called signal-to-noise ratio given by \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\). In this case, \\(g(\\theta) = g(\\mu, \\sigma^2) = \\mu/\\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\\). And, \\(g&#39;(\\theta) = (1/\\sqrt{\\sigma^2},\\, -0.5\\mu/({(\\sigma^2)}^{1.5}))\\). Using the delta theorem result, the MLE of \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\) is given by \\(\\overline X / \\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma^2}\\) and has approximate variance \\[(1/\\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma^2},\\, -0.5\\overline X/({(\\hat\\sigma^2)}^{1.5})) \\begin{bmatrix} \\hat\\sigma^2/n &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 2\\hat\\sigma^4/n \\end{bmatrix} (1/\\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma^2},\\, -0.5\\overline X/({(\\hat\\sigma^2)}^{1.5}))^\\top = \\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\overline X^2}{2n\\hat\\sigma^2}.\\] Then, an approximate CI for \\(\\mu/\\sigma\\) is given by \\[\\left(\\overline X / \\sqrt{\\hat\\sigma^2} \\pm z_{1-\\alpha/2}\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}+\\frac{\\overline X^2}{2n\\hat\\sigma^2}}\\right).\\] "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
